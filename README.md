# SenaiPet | Veterinary Management System (JavaScript)
A robust management platform designed for veterinary clinics, focusing on automated data handling and professional record-keeping.

### 🛠️ Core Functionalities:
* **Inventory & Patient Management**: Developed the logic to handle complex data structures for pets, owners, and medical supplies.
* **CRUD Operations**: Implementation of full Create, Read, Update, and Delete cycles to ensure data persistence and reliability.
* **Business Rules Engine**: Applied conditional JavaScript logic to manage appointment scheduling and clinical status updates.

### 🧠 Strategic Thinking:
This project highlights my ability to build **Information Systems**. Beyond the code, I focused on how data flows through a business—from the initial registration to the final medical report—ensuring that the "President" or "Manager" has clean, organized data to work with.

### 🚀 Tech Highlights:
* **Language**: Modern JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Focus**: Data integrity and modular architecture for easy scaling.
